<p>My Final Project I wanted to make two characters falling in love and I did had a hard time at first, I tried to make it exact with how I wanted to be. First I used Adobe Illustrator 
	to make the characters, I wanted them to look like flat paper figures. Then I decide to create a background to make it look like they are in the magical paradise using pinks and reds.
	Next I imported the file to After Effects to give to create the animation of the two characters holding hands as a big heart appears like a sunrise, and I also animated the small 
	hearts to make them rotate.I did had difficulties on how to use the puppet tool at first and the transform tool but I got use to it by practicing it a little more. Then I lastly 
	used the Audacity solfware for music. I went to the website FreeSound to find a Romantic theme to the aniamtion. I shorten it too 33 seconds. 
	seconds so it can match the same time as my animation.
