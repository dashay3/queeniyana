   <h1>Magic</h1>

   <p>My character's physical trait is her eyes, lips, cheek, and hair. Her personality is very romantic, loyal, respectful, empathy, and helpful. She is the Queen so she moves in a positive way, she walks confident, and strong, giving smiles to everyone she see's. The energy she puts in the world is the ability to give others real true love. She wants her people to be happy in love.</p>
