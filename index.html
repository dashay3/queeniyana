	My Final Project I wanted to make two characters falling in love and I did have a hard time at first, I tried to make it exactly how I wanted to be.
	Artistic inspiration for this project was Love and Disney films. That inspired me to make a Romantic theme for my project. I wanted to make an 
	Animation short for my final. It was about two people becoming lovers at first sight. First I used Adobe Illustrator to make the characters,
	I wanted them to look like flat paper figures. Then I decide to create a background to make it look like they are in the magical paradise using
	pinks and reds. Next I imported the file to After Effects to give to create the animation of the two characters holding hands as a big heart appears
	like a sunrise, and I also animated the small hearts to make them rotate.I did had difficulties on how to use the puppet tool at first and the transform
	tool but I got use to it by practicing it a little more. Then I used the Audacity software for music. I went to the website FreeSound to find a Romantic
	theme to the animation. I shortened it to 33 seconds. seconds so it can match the same time as my animation.  This has changed my Storyboard a lot because 
	I realized I could not move the characters like 3D characters would look like, so I had to make them move almost like a slight rotation, so I had to make
        lots of changes to my idea.
